# Introduction

This is a simple scaffolded Tic Tac Toe game to help our
second graders learn Python.


# Game Play

- The game just renders itself on the terminal window.
- Currently this is a two player game
- The players enter their names
- The players play a match, the match winner will be the first player to win two games


# Challenge

The scaffolded code has implemented some of the tic tac toe game already, specifically:
- All the global variables that are needed already exist, they will not need to be modified (and shouldn't be modified)
- Several functions are finished, but several functions need to be implemented
